### Debouncing Example
- Debouncing is a technique used in web development to limit the frequency of a particular event or function execution. It helps improve performance and efficiency by postponing the execution of a function until a certain period of inactivity has passed.

- The purpose of debouncing is to prevent a function from being called multiple times rapidly, especially in scenarios where an event can trigger the function repeatedly. By introducing a delay, debouncing ensures that the function is only executed after the specified delay has passed without any new triggering events.
